# Scheduling A Visit

MDLIVE helps you create appointments for your users.

You can create video or phone appointments directly with a provider, or you can place the appointment in the queue to be serviced
by the next available provider.

The type of appointment you can schedule for your user changes based on their state and the provider type they want to see.

To learn more about state restrictions, please see our [states documentation](#states).

To learn more about provider type restrictions, please see our provider types page.
